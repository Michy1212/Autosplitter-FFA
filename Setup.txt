This autosplit only works with Gambatte and BGB emulator.

To make it work, you must open the emulator and load the proper ROM then open LiveSplit.

To make it available in LiveSplit, you must add the "Scriptable Auto Splitter" in your layout (in the "Control section").

In the "Scriptable Auto Splitter" section, indicate the location of the autosplit file (ASL format). Now, the possible splits might appears. Check the boxes of the desired splits.
